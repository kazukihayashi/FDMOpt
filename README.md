## FDMopt

Because the path of Rhino and Grasshopper varies from computer to computer. After you open the visual studio solution, you have to **manually re-add the rhino and grasshopper dll**'s path in VS.

And after this, be sure to switch to **Debug64** mode and then click on run.

And then (if everything goes on well) the Rhino will boot up and also you have to manually start Grasshopper.

After grasshopper is opened up, you have to **manually drag the gha file** in your 

	\FDMOpt\FDMopt_gradient_based\bin

into the canvas of grasshopper.

And then you'll find the component in Category Math - Script!

Enjoy FDMopt!
